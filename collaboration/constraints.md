# Constraints

This section outlines the boundaries and considerations for our project to ensure smooth collaboration, efficient learning, and effective task completion.

## External Constraints

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over:
  - project deadlines
  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
  - power or connectivity
  - ...
-->

**These factors outside our control influence how we work on this project.**
- **Platform Requirements:**
  -	Problems must be selected from the workshop's exercises, CodeWars, LeetCode, or similar coding platforms.
  -	Solutions must comply with the workshop's requirements (e.g., unittest, documentation, and clear variable name).
-	**Deadlines:**
	-	Projects must be finished at the timeline set by the MIT Emerging Talent program.
	-	Each member must solve and review problems within the agreed-upon timeframes.
-	**Tools and Resources:**
	-	GitHub must be used for version control, communication, and documentation.
	-	The team must rely on publicly available resources (e.g., online tutorials and documentation) to enhance learning.



## Internal Constraints: Involuntary

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->
**These are limitations or challenges within the team that we need to navigate effectively.**
  - **Experience Levels:**
    - Team members have varying levels of experience in programming, unit testing, and documentation.
    - Some members may require more time or support to complete tasks.
- **Availability:**
   - Team members may have different schedules and commitments, limiting synchronous collaboration opportunities.
- Technical Skills:
  - Limited familiarity with tools like Git, GitHub workflows, or unit testing frameworks.


## Internal Constraints: Voluntary

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
-->
These are self-imposed rules or boundaries designed to improve collaboration and learning outcomes.
- **Unit Testing:**
  - All submitted solutions must include unit tests to verify correctness and edge cases.
  - Use Pythonâ€™s unittest module (or equivalent) for testing.
- **Documentation Standards:**
  - All code must include meaningful comments explaining the logic.
  - Problem solutions must include documentation with:
    - Problem description.
    - Approach and thought process.
    - Test cases used.
- **Communication Protocols:**
  - Use GitHub Issues to discuss problems and tasks.
  - At least one other member must review pull requests before merging.
  - Constructive feedback is required for all reviews.
- **Collaborative Learning:**
  - Each member must share insights or challenges they faced during problem-solving to help others learn.
  -	Regular check-ins (via GitHub comments or virtual meetings) to ensure alignment.
