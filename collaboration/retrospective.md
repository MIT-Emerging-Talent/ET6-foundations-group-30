# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Putting off important tasks until the last minute—it created
  unnecessary stress and rushed solutions.
- Overcomplicating problems when simple, straightforward answers
  would have worked just fine.
- Using `git add .` instead of specifying files, which led to
  accidental commits.
- Renaming files directly in the file explorer instead of using
  `git mv` for proper version control.
- Relying too heavily on LLMs for code reviews without careful
  manual checks.
- Hesitating to ask for help, causing delays when problems could
  have been resolved faster.

## Continue Doing

- Keeping communication open, clear, and consistent to ensure
  everyone stays aligned.
- Holding regular, productive team meetings to track progress and
  tackle challenges together.
- Reviewing code thoroughly while adhering to GitHub best
  practices.
- Writing clear commit messages and using pull requests
  effectively.
- Encouraging teammates and fostering a supportive, motivated
  work environment.

## Start Doing

- Investing more time in planning before diving into code to
  clarify strategies and avoid missteps.
- Asking for feedback earlier to catch issues sooner and improve
  outcomes.
- Practicing merge conflict resolution and getting better at
  using CI/CD processes.
- Deepening knowledge of CI pipelines to ensure each commit
  passes necessary checks.
- Writing comprehensive unit tests and honing debugging skills
  to create more robust code.
- Using `git mv` for renaming files to maintain accurate version
  control history.
- Staging specific files during commits to avoid accidental
  changes.
- Breaking down larger tasks into smaller, well-defined issues
  for better project tracking.
- Structuring the project board professionally by linking PRs to
  issues and using dedicated channels for bugs, features, and
  discussions.

## Lessons Learned

- **Time Management**: Procrastination leads to stress—small,
  steady progress keeps things manageable.
- **Simpler Solutions**: Often, the simplest approach is the most
  effective and easiest to debug.
- **Communication**: Regular, clear communication aligns efforts
  and prevents confusion.
- **GitHub Mastery**: Understanding pull requests, merges, and
  conflicts is essential for smooth collaboration.
- **CI/CD**: Passing pipeline checks requires precision, but it
  greatly enhances quality and consistency.
- **Feedback Matters**: Code reviews are learning opportunities—
  both giving and receiving feedback boost problem-solving and
  critical thinking skills.
- **LLM Caution**: While helpful, LLMs aren’t infallible—manual
  checks and critical thinking are non-negotiable.
- **Ask for Help**: Asking for help early saves time, reduces
  frustration, and accelerates learning.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Initial setup and early task management went smoothly.
- Meetings were effective, and GitHub workflows like branches,
  commits, and pull requests were utilized successfully.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Merge conflict resolution and CI check passing were more
  challenging than expected.
- Some tasks dragged into the final stages due to unexpected
  technical hurdles.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Implemented structured project boards, added meetings, and
  refined issues for better coordination.
- Learned new tools and libraries to meet specific project needs.

### Or remove extra steps?

- Eliminated redundant documentation and simplified workflows
  for a more streamlined process.
